Bust-A-Move is a clone of the video game with the same name. Here's a general overview on how to play the game:
* The game is initialized with a few bubbles on the board and a bubble cannon that shoots bubbles.
* The bubble cannon's position is fixed and can rotate
* Shoot same colored bubbles in groups of three or more to pop them
* The game is won when the board is cleared of all bubbles.

At the end of this week, this app should:

* Have a functional bubble cannon that rotates and shoots based on key input.
* Bubbles that have been shot must ricochet off the boundaries until it touches another bubble or the top boundary.
* Bubbles in groups of three or more that are the same color should pop (be removed from the playing field).
* The game is won when all bubbles are cleared from the board.
