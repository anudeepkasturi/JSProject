##Minimum Viable Product

Bust-A-Move is a clone of the video game with the same name. Place same colored bubbles in groups of three or more to pop them, and the game is won when the board is cleared of all bubbles. At the end of this week, this app should:

* Have a functional bubble cannon that moves and shoots based on key input.
* Bubbles that have been shot must ricochet off the boundaries until it touches another bubble or the top boundary.
* Bubbles in groups of three or more that are the same color should be removed from the playing field.
* The game is won when all bubbles are cleared from the board.
